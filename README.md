'Almond Tea Bread'

INGREDIENTS:

1 can (8 ounces) almond paste 
1/4 cup butter, softened 
1 cup sugar 
3 large eggs, room temperature 
1-1/2 cups fresh pitted cherries or blueberries 
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided 
4 teaspoons baking powder 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
3/4 cup whole milk

Directions:

In a large bowl, combine almond paste and butter; beat until well blended. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a small bowl, gently toss cherries and 1 tablespoon flour. Set aside.
Combine the baking powder, salt, remaining flour; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating well after each addition.
Spoon a sixth of the batter into each of two greased and floured 8x4-in. loaf pans; sprinkle layers with half of the fruit. Cover with another layer of batter and sprinkle with remaining fruit. Top with remaining batter; smooth with spatula.
Bake at 350Â° until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1-1/4 hours. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool.
